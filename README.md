# workplace_activity_tracking
Code from my master's degree in Mechatronic Systems Engineering. My research included refining and deploying a low cost, objective device and algorithm to classify human activities as sitting, standing, or walking from foot pressure measures. This involved developing a novel device consisting of sensors and a micro-controller, and applying machine learning techniques to analyze sensor data.
